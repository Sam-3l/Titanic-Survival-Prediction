# Titanic Survival Prediction

![Titanic](titanic.jpg)

This project is a machine learning endeavor aimed at predicting passenger survival outcomes on the Titanic. By leveraging data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling techniques, we aim to create a model that can effectively determine whether a passenger would have survived the historic voyage.

## Overview

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, leading to the deaths of over 1,500 passengers and crew members. This project uses a dataset of Titanic passenger information to build a predictive model that can help us understand the factors that influenced survival rates.
